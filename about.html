			<p>We are looking for self-directed individuals with a lot of enthusiasm
			to help us build our site. Flexible hours and telecommuting encouraged
			because we don't really have offices (just the Starbucks down the street).
			Self-starting a must, along with being willing to work 100-hour weeks for
			little pay.</p>
			<p>Our work environment is excellent. We are located in the middle of a hub
			of activity where employees have the opportunity to interact with a variety
			of people, although they generally have little time to do so. If you're
			interested, drop us a line at
			<a href="mailto:abuse@google.com">jobs@idateu.net</a>.</p>
