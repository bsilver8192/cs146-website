      <h1>About iDateU</h1>
      <p>iDateU is the best new dating site their is! Our goal is to pair our users with a charitable celebrity based on what he or she seeks in a date. Since we want our
      users to have a pleasant dinner together, we want to ask them a series of
      questions so that they will be paired with a celebrity who also enjoys similar
      things. The celebrities who agreed to participate will have also taken the
      same survey as our end users. We want to ensure the date is
      fun for both the user and celebrity. For each match made, iDateU donates 45% of the money paid to a cause the celebrity believes in.
      We believe that this idea will really take off, and will be extremly beneficial to all parties involved.</p>

        <h2>You</h2>
        <p>We are looking for self-directed individuals with a lot of enthusiasm
        to help us build our site. Flexible hours and telecommuting encouraged
        because we don't really have offices (just the Starbucks down the street).
        Self-starting a must, along with being willing to work 100-hour weeks for
        little pay.</p>
        <p>Our work environment is excellent. We are located in the middle of a hub
        of activity where employees have the opportunity to interact with a variety
        of people, although they generally have little time to do so. If you're
        interested, drop us a line at
        <a href="mailto:abuse@google.com">jobs@idateu.net</a>.</p>
