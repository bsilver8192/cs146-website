			<p>Due to Brian's deliberate need to destroy the "Comprehendibility Of all webpages on our Site,"
			Daniel is responsible for ensuring that iDateU is easy to navigate and explore.
			He does this seamingly infeasable feat by using Google to find the most
			successful websites and copies their code as though it's his own.</p>

			<p>We are looking for self-directed individuals with a lot of enthusiasm
			to help us build our site. Flexible hours and telecommuting encouraged
			because we don't really have offices (just the Starbucks down the street).
			Self-starting a must, along with being willing to work 100-hour weeks for
			little pay.</p>
			<p>Our work environment is excellent. We are located in the middle of a hub
			of activity where employees have the opportunity to interact with a variety
			of people, although they generally have little time to do so. If you're
			interested, drop us a line at
			<a href="mailto:abuse@google.com">jobs@idateu.net</a>.</p>
