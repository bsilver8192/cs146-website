      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p>By using this website, you agree to the following terms and conditions:
      <ol type=I>
        <li>If you are a grader, you will give us an A on this assignment.</li>
        <li>Don't misuse our services. If you want to, you will probably
        succeed in hacking our servers because we're incompetent, but please
        don't. Be nice.</li>
        <li>Using our Services does not give you any rights. In fact, it takes
        many of them away.</li>
        <li>Any and all content that you have created throughout your life is
        now our property, including that which is submitted to this website.</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for anything, least of all this website.</li>
        <li>You give up all rights, including (but not limited to) those to
        life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Your initial and continued use (including viewing) of this site is
      interpreted as your agreement to these terms. If you do not like them, tough
      luck; you should get a good lawyer because we do too, and we will fight to
      keep you in slavery as you are consenting to by using this site.</p>
      <p>Use of this website is defined as causing the information contained herein
      to be transferred to the person or property of you or your designee by any
      means electronic or otherwise.</p>

      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>There aren't too many ways you can use our products because they are
      totally and utterly useless. However, in the event you decide to do so
      anyways, you might share information with us. This Privacy Policy explains
      what happens afterwards (and before too).</p>
      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We collect any and all information that we can, legally or otherwise.
      We doubt that we will successfully collect any information because a)
      our website doesn't actually work and b) we're incompetent freshmen CS
      students. However, in the event that we do, you hereby agree that we can
      do anything whatsoever with it, including using it to stalk you (or others),
      selling it, and publicizing it for free.</p>
      <h2>Transparency and choice</h2>
      <!-- Don't want to make this too long because that would be bordering on
      transparency, which is to be avoided at all costs. -->
      <p>Our goal is to be as opaque as possible. If you have any concerns related
      to this, please send us an email at
      <a href="mailto:opacity@idateu.net">opacity@idateu.net</a>.</p>
      <h2>Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
      <p>You have little to no ability to update your personal information. This is
      intentional.
      &lt;!-- When (l)users are allowed to access and update anything, they tend to
      mess it up, so we want to avoid that at all costs. --&gt;
      We want to avoid giving people tools that may be too complicated and confusing.
      This is to make our user experience more betterer. &lt;!-- and reduce support
      costs. --&gt;</p>
